# Drupal 8 or 9 Role Manager  

## Role Notice Manager  
- based on Drupal 8 or 9 module development video by Ted Bowman

## Create a Settings Form for the Notices  
First draft of the form has one role only.  Then the next uses a tree to set up as many textareas as there are roles for the site.

## Set up a Block to Show the Notices 
Simple set up for a block that can appear anywhere in the block system.  

### v1.0
Just the basics - get the Controller to work

### v1.1
There is now a form that takes in textarea input information based on role.  It gets displayed in a block. The information is saved via State -- not yet using services (nor configuration).

### v1.2
Not available yet - but this will use a service.
