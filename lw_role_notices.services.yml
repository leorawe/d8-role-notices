# This file registers this module's service(s).
services:
  # We only need 1 service to get and set our notices.
  # Notice that we use our module machine name as the first part of our service name.
  # This ensures we won't have a naming conflict with another module
  lw_role_notices.notice_manager:
    # This is the class that our service will be.
    # This tells the Drupal's service container which class to use for our service instance.
    class: Drupal\lw_role_notices\NoticesManager
    # Our service depends on other services.
    # We declare them as arguments of our service so that the
    # Service Container will provide them as arguments to our class's constructor.
    arguments: ['@current_user', '@state', '@module_handler']

    # You may be wondering how you would figure out where these services are defined.
    # Most Drupal services are declared in *.services.yml files.
    # So for example to find out where "@current_user" is define search like this
    # inside Drupal code base:
    #  text: "current_user:"
    #  file name pattern: *.services.yml
    #
    # Could you find these services? What classes are they?
    # Notice that these classes match the types of the arguments to our service's
    # constructor.
